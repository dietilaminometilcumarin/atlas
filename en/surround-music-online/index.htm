    <h1>What is Surround Music?</h1>

    <p><strong>Surround music</strong>, also known as <em>spatial audio</em>, refers to audio recordings and playback systems designed to immerse the listener in a three-dimensional sound field. Unlike traditional stereo sound (which uses only two channels: left and right), surround music uses multiple audio channels to position sound around the listener â€” including from behind, above, and in front.</p>

    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>Surround sound is typically delivered through formats such as <strong>5.1 surround</strong> (five speakers + subwoofer), <strong>7.1 surround</strong>, or advanced systems like <strong>Dolby Atmos</strong>, which adds vertical space to audio. These formats allow artists and producers to place instruments and effects in a three-dimensional space, giving the listener a much more realistic and immersive experience.</p>

    <h2>Why Listen to Surround Music?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>âœ… Enhanced immersion for movies, music, and gaming</li>
        <li>âœ… A new way to experience your favorite albums</li>
